# Minsky-AI-Roadmap
Roadmap to learn AI for associates at Minsky Lab@[Next Tech Lab](https://nextech.io/home)

## Data Structures and Algorithms
+ [Stanford ALgorithms - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) or
+ [Introduction to Algorithms (MIT 6.006)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/)
+ [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science (MIT 6.0002)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/) 
+ Learn any one programming language really well and compete on Codechef, Hackerrank, HackerEarth,etc

## Data Science Stack
Best places to learn - https://www.python-course.eu/ or https://www.datacamp.com/
+ Python
+ NumPy
+ Pandas
+ Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Things you should know

Note :
+ Implement Machine Learning models from scratch using Python
+ Once you're comfortable implementing models from scratch, learn scikit-learn and compare performance
+ Practice on Kaggle to get your skiills ---> :sunglasses:
