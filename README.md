# McCarthy-AI-Roadmap

Roadmap to learn AI for associates at McCarthy Lab@[Next Tech Lab](https://www.nexttechlab.io/)

**Note** : *This is a rough roadmap to guide you on your Machine Learning journey. We recommend everyone to focus on core CS principles and industry-standard tech stacks with a strong focus on Machine Learning theory and development. This might look overwhelming at first, but it's really not.* ðŸ™‚

## 1. Data Science Stack

* Best places to learn -
  * [python-course.eu](https://www.python-course.eu/)
  * [datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/)
  * [pythonprogramming.net](https://www.pythonprogramming.net/)
* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib and Seaborn
* scikit-learn
* SciPy

## 2. Technology Stack

* [The Missing Semester from your CS education] (https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
* Basic computer architecture:
  * [GPU vs CPU](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2009/12/16/whats-the-difference-between-a-cpu-and-a-gpu/)
  * [File Systems](https://wiki.microfocus.com/index.php/File_System_Primer)

## 3. Deep Learning Frameworks

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
  * [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/assets/deep-learning/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch.pdf) - excellent resource for learning
  * Use [fast.ai](https://docs.fast.ai/training.html) as High level wrapper (not recommended due to instability of the library and lack of adequate documentation)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/)
  * Use [tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) as a High level wrapper
  * [Effective TensorFlow](https://github.com/vahidk/EffectiveTensorflow)

## 4. Reinforcement Learning - Libraries
